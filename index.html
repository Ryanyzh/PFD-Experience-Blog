                            When my adviser initially mentioned this module to me, I was eager to take it since I knew it would be a little hackathon where we students would use the information we had to address problems in the real world. In my secondary school years, I participated in a variety of similar hackathons organized by various institutions and groups, including the 24-hour Startathon Junior Competition at River Valley High School and the MSA PolyFintech100 API Hackathon, where participants had to come up with a prototype to address a predetermined problem statement. Because I had previously taken part in a hackathon, I had an idea of what it would be like to collaborate with students from various classes who had diverse backgrounds and to come up with answers. When I learned more about the problem statements that had been made public the week before school started, I instantly focused on the three challenge statements provided by OCBC Bank since they stood out. Even though I felt that the other three problem statements from Workato and the NP School of ICT, which center around the themes of sustainability, automation with remote working, and social entrepreneurship, were not as interesting and difficult as those from OCBC, I read through the other three after reading the problem statements from OCBC. When I first read each problem statement, my mind was racing with concepts, both reasonable and outlandish, and I immediately began to do some research on each of them. By the end of the day, I couldn't decide which challenge statement to use.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The initial OCBC challenge involved coming up with a solution that would enable applicants and bank employees to manage, update, and keep track of the status of the application using the Digital Securities account and product. The second OCBC challenge involved creating a user-friendly and scalable platform that could execute an increase in test cases due to the rise in bank application volume automatically and without human involvement. The most recent OCBC objective was to create a smart electronic detection system that does not obstruct customers from using our automated teller machines (ATMs) while detecting fraudulent activities. Since the team members were one of the important factors in performing well for the module, I consulted with my friends from my class as well as other classes to find out which challenge they were leaning towards. However, there were a variety of replies from those who chose the three challenges. I therefore intended to stick with my choice on the day when we had to choose the challenge statement based on the classrooms that were given to them.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            I went around the various classes to see where my pals were sat when I arrived at school 45 minutes before class started to reserve a place for myself. Selecting my final challenge statement classroom was a nerve-wracking event because it decides the problem that I will be working on for the next five months with individuals I know or don't know. When I noticed a group of friends from my CCA in the Scam Alert class while the rest of my pals were in a different session for the OCBC cross-browser platform automation challenge, I was on the verge of losing it. After deliberating for 15 minutes, I ultimately decided to follow my instinct and choose the OCBC ATM 3.0 Scam Alert challenge statement since it was the one I thought was the strongest. As soon as I walked into the classroom, I proceeded to seat with my friends. We started chatting about why we chose this challenge statement and some of the thoughts that have come to mind. The majority of the kids in the class, who gradually filled it, were new to me. I also had a lot of anxiety because I wasn't sure if the friends I was seated with would be my partners for this module. I also came to understand that my group was powerful because we are all experts in our own fields. Consider the fact that my group included Wai Hang, who was very interested in handling the back-end coding, Jia Chen, who specialized in developing mobile apps, Addison, who had expertise in AI and CV, and Jimmy, who had expertise in developing websites, while I was able to handle the front-end side of things, including the UI and the design of other products. My lecturer, Mr. Suresh, gave us a brief administrative overview of what is expected during the entire module and went over the assignment specifics before the course officially began at 11 a.m. There are two assignments altogether in this module, with the second serving as a follow-up to the first. In the first assignment, we were to develop a prototype product that addressed the problem statement we were working on, and we had to present it to a panel of judges at the OCBC campus during the White-Space Week in week five. The task groupings were then finalized as part of the lesson's goal. Initially, our professor gave each of us a piece of paper on which we were to write our areas of interest, talents, and weaknesses. These anonymous slips were then gathered and mixed together. Our professor then gave us some time to come up with challenge statement ideas on our own before giving us the duty of posting them on a Padlet board for the class to see. Everyone in the class went through each other's ideas as they were being written down, and they all engaged in table-level discussion about what to include and other related themes. After the allotted time had passed, our lecturer instructed us to vote for the posts we found most fascinating, and after taking a "gallery stroll" through the entire Padlet debate, each of us was given one vote to like the post that most connected with us. I continued to hope that my table mates would end up in my group despite expecting how our instructor would assign groups based on the previous work. Then we started to select our favorite posts. It was silly of us to choose to agree with each other's post at that time because I knew my table mates better and most of our inputs were similar; we had no idea what would happen next. Following the voting, our lecturer read out the top five students' posts that received the most likes and announced that they would be the group leaders for each of the five groups. We were astonished since we had unintentionally voted for each other's posts, my pals and I. As most of my friends who were seated at the same table as me, including myself, were picked to be group leaders, I started to worry. Then our professor placed the slips of paper on the table so that the group leaders may select 4 additional people to form their groups with. I was a little bummed to have to leave my pals and join a new group. I quickly grabbed my friend Wai Hang, who was seated at the same table as me, and convinced him to join my group with three other students as we started choosing our group members. After assembling the group, we sat down together and started introducing ourselves as our lecturer entered our names into the computer system. Although there was initially a tense moment among the crew, I was able to break the ice by asking everyone to introduce themselves and talk a bit about their personalities and hobbies. Before the lesson was finished, our lecturer gave a last announcement and dismissed the class. But I was upset when I left the lesson.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On the following lesson, we sat in our groups to start getting to know one another and familiarizing ourselves with our working methods. As a group leader, I had a deeper understanding of their skill sets and expertise for this challenge statement in that class and also learned all of their names: Wai Hang, Hwee Min, Cheng Xuan, and Ahmad. I was surprised to find that three of them—Hwee Min, Cheng Xuan, and Ahmad—did not enjoy programming, which concerned me because Wai Hang and I might end up doing the majority of the work. I then started to take the lead in the debate to come up with alternative types of solutions and to do additional study on the challenge statement. They had the remainder of the week up to the following lesson to write down what they had learned and how they planned to address the problems. The group selected C# as the programming language and the Universal Window Platform as the coding platform for the remainder of the assignment during that lesson. Additionally, our professor visited each group to inquire about our strategy and preparation for the assignment, which was due during the fifth week of classes. He also gave us more information about the three-day hackathon and what to anticipate. In addition, Mr. Hendri, our mentor from OCBC, came to school to help us with this work since he has more background knowledge and expertise in the field. He was kind with us and always took the time to join us when we had lessons, which I appreciated.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            The following week, as our lecturer had reminded us, we had only a limited amount of time to code out 30 to 50% of the initial assignment by the middle of week 5 for pitching, so we gathered once more to talk more about what we had noted in the Google document shared among the group. We spent no time in getting to work on exchanging ideas, discussing everything from the problem analysis to the various solutions—from using speech recognition to redesigning the actual ATM—between each other. Every member of the group had the opportunity to contribute through this process, and as we walked around the room, the group offered recommendations and improvements. While some concepts were dropped, others were maintained and improved. After confirming the ideas we've chosen, we look at how these several concepts might be combined into one, which will be presented to our lecturer, Mr. Suresh, and our mentor, Mr. Hendri, in the following class. I also created a scheduling plan for the group throughout this session so that everyone could stay on track and not miss anything. The group was still held back, but I was able to convince everyone to pitch in so that things could get done quickly. Then, from the insertion of the card to the cash withdrawal, we organized our solution to correspond to the user flow when they interact with the ATM. We ensured that the security of the user experience was examined at each level, and that our solution could largely protect against any conceivable sorts of scams that might occur, as determined by our research.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the following lesson, we presented and discussed our answer with our mentor and lecturer so that they could provide us comments following their individual group reviews. They clarified why some of the suggestions weren't workable since they could negatively affect how users interacted with the ATM, as was expressly noted in the challenge statement brief. Additionally, our mentor explained how some of our ideas had already been put into practice in the real world and that duplicating them would not benefit us. They also advised us to consider the future, put ourselves in the position of ATM users, and evaluate how processes are carried out from their perspective. After hearing this, I lost motivation because most of our ideas had been rejected, and we would need to spend another week brainstorming solutions and new ideas. However, I was aware that this was all a part of the learning process and focused on the objective. Following a brief conversation in our group, we swiftly discussed how to address this issue in light of the insightful feedback we received. We discussed it and came up with a strategy whereby half of the group would continue to conduct additional research using the questions provided, and the other half would use the days left before the next lesson to try out using an OCBC ATM and report back with any results they may have.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            The team gathered once more for the first lesson of week three to review the areas that needed improvement based on the feedback provided the week before. After compiling everything into one document, we started debating which solutions to choose from the list and why each of our individual inputs was placed there. We then finish our solution after merging the information from the two groups, selecting the most pertinent ones that could fit into the user flow and satisfy the challenge statement's criteria of preventing scams. Since we were able to improve on our mentor's and lecturer's suggestions, I felt more at ease this time when delivering our draft solution. But during the third week of classes, I learned that one or two group members hadn't finished their portion of the study because they had said they were too busy with other schoolwork or had outside responsibilities. I acknowledged their concerns and informed them that this assignment would require a team effort, so they should schedule their time carefully if they wanted to succeed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We presented our idea to the lecturer and mentor in the following lesson to receive their approval. As the group's facilitator, I presented our ideas to them and explained why we chose to move forward with them. Thankfully, this time they agreed with our proposal and gave the go-ahead. However, they also cautioned us against being overly ambitious and offered additional suggestions on how some of the features could be further developed to make it more complicated and appealing. I exhaled at that point in relief at being allowed to proceed to the following stage. We then start working on our solution while using the time to gather more information to refine our solution ideas, taking into consideration their feedback. I then began dividing up the tasks among the team members according to their skills. I started by listing each task in the paper and asking each team member whether they could code out each feature from the tasks. To my astonishment, all of the group members—with the exception of Wai Hang—refuse to take on any of them, citing their lack of familiarity with coding in a new programming language (UWP with C#). I was forced to abide by their demands and distribute the work between Wai Hang and myself. I informed Wai Hang that I would need some time to learn about it and that my code solution might not meet his expectations because he had prior expertise coding in this language. He gently assured me that he would be happy to come out and assist me if I needed it. I expressed my gratitude to him for joining the team and assured everyone that we could collaborate to come up with something good for the hackathon pitch. I handed Wai Hang a few more features to work on while I took care of some of the simpler ones based on his skill set and experience. I also made it known to the other group members that this cannot be a 2-person job and that doing so will disadvantage them over the next few weeks. I then started watching movies to educate myself on the workings of programming language syntax, including its syntax and how files were saved. Since this was something I had never learned before and that the school had not taught me, I used internet resources like LinkedIn Study, YouTube, and ChatGPT to aid in my learning. Wai Hang was kind enough to patiently explain the important information to me whenever I was unsure about a particular section. This week, I also looked for further details about how to make it possible for fingerprint and speech recognition to be incorporated with this UWP application. It was a challenging process because, first of all, the application was complicated (since UWP is a Windows desktop app, which I had never used before), second, I had a limited amount of time to learn it (on top of other schoolwork and CCAs), so I had to schedule my time wisely, and third, there was more pressure because Wai Hang and I were the only ones responsible for finishing the project on time.

                            After the break, when we got back to school, our professor gave us more information about what to finish and the standards he had for assignment 2.
                            Regrouping, we discussed the comments made by our lecturer, one of the judges during the hackathon in week five at the OCBC campus, during our pitch.
                            After that, we researched and made specific plans for our work because the majority of the marks were determined by individual grades. As a follow-up to the previous assignment, we were required to make significant changes to our answer and finish what could not be finished in the first assignment for this second assignment.

I will be in charge of the OTP, Kill Switch Process, and other front-end UI design (digital keypad), while Wai Hang will be in charge of setting up the database and the backend codes to link the pages, Hwee Min will be in charge of the dashboard, and Cheng Xuan and Ahmad will be in charge of the machine learning feature After reaching an understanding, we discussed our individual roles in this work with our lecturer and obtained his approval. The team's overall timetable from the current week to the submission week was then set out by myself. Since they didn't work with the codes in assignment 1, I also gave the team members of the group some advice on how to approach this assignment.

                            Prior to the upcoming Wednesday lesson, I first received an update from everyone regarding their research into their own feature, their strategy to incorporate it into the solution, and their questions. Our lecturer followed up with us one again and answered our questions. I started my own independent research.

                            The crew underwent yet another weekly exam to make sure everyone was performing according to plan, but they weren't. I had previously urged the two machine learning experts to gather data and conduct further research into their feature, but they had not.
                            I began writing the operational pages' front end code before conducting additional research on the OTP. For my role in the OTP side (married), I also consulted Wai Hang because I had concerns about it.

                            In this week, I started to try to implement the OTP but with faced with errors time and time again. But, I managed to complete the kill switch process and took the remaining time to prepare for the slides and videos submission as Wai Hang helped me to debug the problems.

                            -	Had Wai Hang come in to help out for the OTP section 
                            -	Prepare the base slides used for editing (slides design)
                            -	Editing the content to make it more consistent

                            On the Monday, we did a dry run and rehearsed our presentation so that everyone was clear on our individual section for the presentational and what to present for the demo
                            Comes the day of the presentation on Wednesday, nervous feeling and it managed to go well. 
                            Overall, I felt that this module was an amazing experience.
