                            When my adviser initially mentioned this module to me, I was eager to take it since I knew it would be a little hackathon where we students would use the information we had to address problems in the real world. In my secondary school years, I participated in a variety of similar hackathons organized by various institutions and groups, including the 24-hour Startathon Junior Competition at River Valley High School and the MSA PolyFintech100 API Hackathon, where participants had to come up with a prototype to address a predetermined problem statement. Because I had previously taken part in a hackathon, I had an idea of what it would be like to collaborate with students from various classes who had diverse backgrounds and to come up with answers. When I learned more about the problem statements that had been made public the week before school started, I instantly focused on the three challenge statements provided by OCBC Bank since they stood out. Even though I felt that the other three problem statements from Workato and the NP School of ICT, which center around the themes of sustainability, automation with remote working, and social entrepreneurship, were not as interesting and difficult as those from OCBC, I read through the other three after reading the problem statements from OCBC. When I first read each problem statement, my mind was racing with concepts, both reasonable and outlandish, and I immediately began to do some research on each of them. By the end of the day, I couldn't decide which challenge statement to use.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The initial OCBC challenge involved coming up with a solution that would enable applicants and bank employees to manage, update, and keep track of the status of the application using the Digital Securities account and product. The second OCBC challenge involved creating a user-friendly and scalable platform that could execute an increase in test cases due to the rise in bank application volume automatically and without human involvement. The most recent OCBC objective was to create a smart electronic detection system that does not obstruct customers from using our automated teller machines (ATMs) while detecting fraudulent activities. Since the team members were one of the important factors in performing well for the module, I consulted with my friends from my class as well as other classes to find out which challenge they were leaning towards. However, there were a variety of replies from those who chose the three challenges. I therefore intended to stick with my choice on the day when we had to choose the challenge statement based on the classrooms that were given to them.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            I went around the various classes to see where my pals were sat when I arrived at school 45 minutes before class started to reserve a place for myself. Selecting my final challenge statement classroom was a nerve-wracking event because it decides the problem that I will be working on for the next five months with individuals I know or don't know. When I noticed a group of friends from my CCA in the Scam Alert class while the rest of my pals were in a different session for the OCBC cross-browser platform automation challenge, I was on the verge of losing it. After deliberating for 15 minutes, I ultimately decided to follow my instinct and choose the OCBC ATM 3.0 Scam Alert challenge statement since it was the one I thought was the strongest. As soon as I walked into the classroom, I proceeded to seat with my friends. We started chatting about why we chose this challenge statement and some of the thoughts that have come to mind. The majority of the kids in the class, who gradually filled it, were new to me. I also had a lot of anxiety because I wasn't sure if the friends I was seated with would be my partners for this module. I also came to understand that my group was powerful because we are all experts in our own fields. Consider the fact that my group included Wai Hang, who was very interested in handling the back-end coding, Jia Chen, who specialized in developing mobile apps, Addison, who had expertise in AI and CV, and Jimmy, who had expertise in developing websites, while I was able to handle the front-end side of things, including the UI and the design of other products. My lecturer, Mr. Suresh, gave us a brief administrative overview of what is expected during the entire module and went over the assignment specifics before the course officially began at 11 a.m. There are two assignments altogether in this module, with the second serving as a follow-up to the first. In the first assignment, we were to develop a prototype product that addressed the problem statement we were working on, and we had to present it to a panel of judges at the OCBC campus during the White-Space Week in week five. The task groupings were then finalized as part of the lesson's goal. Initially, our lecturer gave each of us a piece of paper on which we were to write our areas of interest, talents, and weaknesses. These anonymous slips were then gathered and mixed together. Our lecturer then gave us some time to come up with challenge statement ideas on our own before giving us the duty of posting them on a Padlet board for the class to see. Everyone in the class went through each other's ideas as they were being written down, and they all engaged in table-level discussion about what to include and other related themes. After the allotted time had passed, our lecturer instructed us to vote for the posts we found most fascinating, and after taking a "gallery stroll" through the entire Padlet debate, each of us was given one vote to like the post that most connected with us. I continued to hope that my table mates would end up in my group despite expecting how our instructor would assign groups based on the previous work. Then we started to select our favorite posts. It was silly of us to choose to agree with each other's post at that time because I knew my table mates better and most of our inputs were similar; we had no idea what would happen next. Following the voting, our lecturer read out the top five students' posts that received the most likes and announced that they would be the group leaders for each of the five groups. We were astonished since we had unintentionally voted for each other's posts, my pals and I. As most of my friends who were seated at the same table as me, including myself, were picked to be group leaders, I started to worry. Then our lecturer placed the slips of paper on the table so that the group leaders may select 4 additional people to form their groups with. I was a little bummed to have to leave my pals and join a new group. I quickly grabbed my friend Wai Hang, who was seated at the same table as me, and convinced him to join my group with three other students as we started choosing our group members. After assembling the group, we sat down together and started introducing ourselves as our lecturer entered our names into the computer system. Although there was initially a tense moment among the crew, I was able to break the ice by asking everyone to introduce themselves and talk a bit about their personalities and hobbies. Before the lesson was finished, our lecturer gave a last announcement and dismissed the class. But I was upset when I left the lesson.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On the following lesson, we sat in our groups to start getting to know one another and familiarizing ourselves with our working methods. As a group leader, I had a deeper understanding of their skill sets and expertise for this challenge statement in that class and also learned all of their names: Wai Hang, Hwee Min, Cheng Xuan, and Ahmad. I was surprised to find that three of them—Hwee Min, Cheng Xuan, and Ahmad—did not enjoy programming, which concerned me because Wai Hang and I might end up doing the majority of the work. I then started to take the lead in the debate to come up with alternative types of solutions and to do additional study on the challenge statement. They had the remainder of the week up to the following lesson to write down what they had learned and how they planned to address the problems. The group selected C# as the programming language and the Universal Window Platform as the coding platform for the remainder of the assignment during that lesson. Additionally, our lecturer visited each group to inquire about our strategy and preparation for the assignment, which was due during the fifth week of classes. He also gave us more information about the three-day hackathon and what to anticipate. In addition, Mr. Hendri, our mentor from OCBC, came to school to help us with this work since he has more background knowledge and expertise in the field. He was kind with us and always took the time to join us when we had lessons, which I appreciated.

                            The following week, as our lecturer had reminded us, we had only a limited amount of time to code out 30 to 50% of the initial assignment by the middle of week 5 for pitching, so we gathered once more to talk more about what we had noted in the Google document shared among the group. We spent no time in getting to work on exchanging ideas, discussing everything from the problem analysis to the various solutions—from using speech recognition to redesigning the actual ATM—between each other. Every member of the group had the opportunity to contribute through this process, and as we walked around the room, the group offered recommendations and improvements. While some concepts were dropped, others were maintained and improved. After confirming the ideas we've chosen, we look at how these several concepts might be combined into one, which will be presented to our lecturer, Mr. Suresh, and our mentor, Mr. Hendri, in the following class. I also created a scheduling plan for the group throughout this session so that everyone could stay on track and not miss anything. The group was still held back, but I was able to convince everyone to pitch in so that things could get done quickly. Then, from the insertion of the card to the cash withdrawal, we organized our solution to correspond to the user flow when they interact with the ATM. We ensured that the security of the user experience was examined at each level, and that our solution could largely protect against any conceivable sorts of scams that might occur, as determined by our research.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the following lesson, we presented and discussed our answer with our mentor and lecturer so that they could provide us comments following their individual group reviews. They clarified why some of the suggestions weren't workable since they could negatively affect how users interacted with the ATM, as was expressly noted in the challenge statement brief. Additionally, our mentor explained how some of our ideas had already been put into practice in the real world and that duplicating them would not benefit us. They also advised us to consider the future, put ourselves in the position of ATM users, and evaluate how processes are carried out from their perspective. After hearing this, I lost motivation because most of our ideas had been rejected, and we would need to spend another week brainstorming solutions and new ideas. However, I was aware that this was all a part of the learning process and focused on the objective. Following a brief conversation in our group, we swiftly discussed how to address this issue in light of the insightful feedback we received. We discussed it and came up with a strategy whereby half of the group would continue to conduct additional research using the questions provided, and the other half would use the days left before the next lesson to try out using an OCBC ATM and report back with any results they may have.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            The team gathered once more for the first lesson of week three to review the areas that needed improvement based on the feedback provided the week before. After compiling everything into one document, we started debating which solutions to choose from the list and why each of our individual inputs was placed there. We then finish our solution after merging the information from the two groups, selecting the most pertinent ones that could fit into the user flow and satisfy the challenge statement's criteria of preventing scams. Since we were able to improve on our mentor's and lecturer's suggestions, I felt more at ease this time when delivering our draft solution. But during the third week of classes, I learned that one or two group members hadn't finished their portion of the study because they had said they were too busy with other schoolwork or had outside responsibilities. I acknowledged their concerns and informed them that this assignment would require a team effort, so they should schedule their time carefully if they wanted to succeed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We presented our idea to the lecturer and mentor in the following lesson to receive their approval. As the group's facilitator, I presented our ideas to them and explained why we chose to move forward with them. Thankfully, this time they agreed with our proposal and gave the go-ahead. However, they also cautioned us against being overly ambitious and offered additional suggestions on how some of the features could be further developed to make it more complicated and appealing. I exhaled at that point in relief at being allowed to proceed to the following stage. We then start working on our solution while using the time to gather more information to refine our solution ideas, taking into consideration their feedback. I then began dividing up the tasks among the team members according to their skills. I started by listing each task in the paper and asking each team member whether they could code out each feature from the tasks. To my astonishment, all of the group members—with the exception of Wai Hang—refuse to take on any of them, citing their lack of familiarity with coding in a new programming language (UWP with C#). I was forced to abide by their demands and distribute the work between Wai Hang and myself. I informed Wai Hang that I would need some time to learn about it and that my code solution might not meet his expectations because he had prior expertise coding in this language. He gently assured me that he would be happy to come out and assist me if I needed it. I expressed my gratitude to him for joining the team and assured everyone that we could collaborate to come up with something good for the hackathon pitch. I handed Wai Hang a few more features to work on while I took care of some of the simpler ones based on his skill set and experience. I also made it known to the other group members that this cannot be a 2-person job and that doing so will disadvantage them over the next few weeks. I then started watching movies to educate myself on the workings of programming language syntax, including its syntax and how files were saved. Since this was something I had never learned before and that the school had not taught me, I used internet resources like LinkedIn Study, YouTube, and ChatGPT to aid in my learning. Wai Hang was kind enough to patiently explain the important information to me whenever I was unsure about a particular section. This week, I also looked for further details about how to make it possible for fingerprint and speech recognition to be incorporated with this UWP application. It was a challenging process because, first of all, the application was complicated (since UWP is a Windows desktop app, which I had never used before), second, I had a limited amount of time to learn it (on top of other schoolwork and CCAs), so I had to schedule my time wisely, and third, there was more pressure because Wai Hang and I were the only ones responsible for finishing the project on time.

                            We returned to class at the beginning of January after a 7-week hiatus from PFD to continue working on Assignment 2. We were instructed to pick up where Assignment 1 left off in this assignment and assess the input provided to us during the hackathon. Based on our progress, we then had to significantly improve the solution. Our lecturer, Mr. Suresh, gave us a briefing on the assignment details at the first lesson on Monday. He covered the deliverables, the grading criteria, and what he was looking for in the work. We then gathered back in our group and started talking about how we were going to approach the task. The criticism given to us during the hackathon was that while the remainder of the presentation demo was strong, the biggest problem was that our proposal lacked conceptualization when we presented it to the judges (how does our idea add value to solving the problem statement). Additionally, our lecturer pointed out that there were still unfinished business from assignment 1 to be dealt with for the second project and that we needed to add fresh perspectives to our existing solution. Taking this suggestion into consideration, I as the group's leader started the conversation by letting everyone know what was left over from assignment 1, which was the machine learning, one-time password, digital keypad, and two-factor authentication. With this knowledge, we spent the next hour coming up with more ideas, sharing them with the group, and asking each other if we should move forward with the solution. During this time, Wai Hang suggested that we build a backend database to store data about previous clients that could also be utilized by the machine learning component that was moved down from assignment 1. Everyone agreed that it was an excellent idea, and as Wai Hang was the only person in the group who was proficient in backend languages and had proposed it, I chose to assign Wai Hang the implementation of that feature so he could work on it. In that session, I also came up with a few suggestions, such implementing face recognition as part of the 2FA because it was already built into existing ATMs and building a dashboard, which was what Mr. Hendri suggested in assignment 1. The concept was pursued since the group members approved of the suggestion. The remainder of the group also made an effort to generate fresh, intriguing ideas, but despite their research, they were unsuccessful. Soon after our chat, we started assigning the job to each other. Since the emphasis of this final project is more on the individual aspect and less on the team aspect. Wai Hang and I won't be tanking for the assignment this time, so the other team members will have to work harder to get the task's required grade. I had to distribute and modify the job evenly to everyone in my role as a leader. We had only been able to finish the withdraw operation pages due to the time constraint in assignment 1, so I volunteered to take on the feature of one time password, which is a way to verify their QR code to authenticate the use and complete the transaction, along with the front-end code for the other operational pages such as Deposit, Transfer, and Balance, as well as the digital keypad feature since it was part of the front-end code in the solution. Wai Hang would be responsible for the facial recognition for the 2FA as well as the database and the remainder of the backend code implementation for the operational pages, thus it would be a pair programming project with me. Regarding Hwee Min, I showed her how to use the dashboard functionality that was used to monitor ongoing ATM fraud in real time and put it on a dashboard for the bank staff to examine and act upon from there. Since Ahmad and Cheng Xuan had prior experience learning how machine learning functions, such as building and testing the model, I chose to provide them the machine learning characteristics that help determine whether the current transaction is fake. I assigned the work to both of them rather than to an individual because machine learning was a challenging feature to accomplish. Once everyone had finished their share, some of us started to code while the others continued their own independent research.

                            We discuss the updates we've received since our last meeting when we meet again in the subsequent lesson. I gave everyone a task from the previous meeting to develop a strategy for how they will implement and use their feature, as well as consider a backup plan in the case that their feature doesn't function. But none of the group members completed their tasks, so I had to step in and make a general plan that everyone could adhere to. Since there are just four weeks till submission, we had to start working on our individual projects and finish them by the deadlines set. Fortunately, Wai Hang has already started working on his back-end feature, where he built the database and updated the back-end codes to connect the MS SQL database and the UWP solution. I also assigned the group members various chores to finish. For example, I instructed Cheng Xuan and Ahmad to collect customer information that will be used not only for their machine learning platform but also for the database Wai Hang is managing and the dashboard Hwee Min is putting into place, both of which call for the display of fraudulent transactions when they are discovered by machine learning. Additionally, I advised both of them to conduct adequate research into the software and machine learning method they would be integrating with the present UWP solution, which the group decided to stick with from assignment 1. I then gave Hwee Min the assignment of creating a basic design for her dashboard and telling me which platform she intended to utilize.

                            The group gathered online in MsTeams for the first lesson of week 13 to go over more from the previous weeks. As I walked around the group, I asked each person what they had read or done the previous week. My ire was especially raised when I learned that Ahmad and Cheng Xuan had not produced any machine learning data as promised on Sunday. Wai Hang would therefore need to produce the data on his end in order to use it for his database feature. When I asked them both for an explanation, they both said they were too busy with other schoolwork, which I didn't think was plausible given that everyone else had other obligations to attend to. I then followed up on their research and asked that they brief me on it, but there hadn't been much work done, which annoyed me much. Hwee Min was the next person I checked on, and I was happy with her current situation because she was able to provide me specific information about her improvement. She was able to develop a front-end user interface for her database and provided me with a list of tools that might be utilized to build the database. I then instructed her to rank the top three programs that could be integrated with the Microsoft SQL Server that Wai Hang was still implementing in the order of which she was most familiar. Wai Hang's absence from the virtual meeting left everyone in the dark regarding his development, which made me a little sad. When it was finally my turn, I explained to the group how, in light of the study I had done the week before, I intended to approach my side of the features. I didn't go into great length about the front-end aspect of things, but I went into more detail about the one-time password implementation, which uses the Azure Communication Services SMS API to transmit the OTP messages in UWP C#. After that lesson, though, I kept looking for alternatives because the SMS API required a fee and wasn't free. I continued by going into greater detail about the strategy we intended to use in light of the schedule. I changed the deadline for all of their features to be incorporated by the weekend before the submission was due on Friday because I could tell that everyone was busy. Knowing that everyone was preoccupied with their tasks and other responsibilities, I offered to take care of the video production and slide designs. I assured them that if they had other commitments and couldn't finish the work for the weekly check-up sessions, I would understand. but cautioned them against doing so because doing so would only cause them to lose their grades. After joining our group call, our instructor inquired about our performance on the second assignment. I updated everyone on our timetable up until the submission deadline as well as how each member had been assigned to a certain feature for the assignment. It impressed him, and he gave us some pointers on how we should proceed. I video phoned Wai Hang in the afternoon of that day to ask him for an update. I was pleased with his development because he had started working on his backend codes and had already constructed the database on his own, albeit with many problems. I told him about the other team members' development and sought his advice on a few issues because he was an expert in the field. I also promised him that by the end of this week, I would finish the portion on the front-end UI design and code it out in our solution, allowing him to finish the back-end scripts.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We all reunited in class for a status update on one another as a group with everyone present for the following lecture. Since the other team members, who did not touch the assignment 1 codes, knew how to establish the solution in their own computers and begin working on it, we first covered how to setup the solution application from the bitbucket repository. I then requested that Hwee Min share with us the new knowledge she had learned from the prior lesson. Wai Hang and I gave her feedback in light of that. She explained to us how she went about utilizing PowerBI to develop her dashboard feature because it was a program she was already familiar with and because it could be linked to Wai Hang's database. She needed assistance with the database integration though because she was unsure how to do it. After he had largely finished completing the database format and had prepared the data for it, Wai Hang happily agreed to assist her. In order to make the dashboard more meaningful, I also assisted her in editing the design she had provided to me during the prior lesson and challenged her to come up with additional complex questions that the dashboard might help to solve. Unsurprisingly, not much progress was made on the side of Cheng Xuan and Ahmad. I also discussed my feature's study and my plans to incorporate it into the solution with Wai Hang. He advised me to use a time-based one-time password that changes every 30 seconds, like those offered by Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. In addition, he showed me how to utilize the app and get the password by scanning a QR code, which was a similar idea to what we want to do. I followed his advice and started looking into it more. Additionally, our lecturer visited each group to answer any questions we had and to offer further explanations. For instance, I questioned him about whether I ought to remove all of the services from the Home Page, including withdrawal, deposit, bill payment, checking CPF information, etc. He explained to me that the pages for deposits, transfers, and account balances are among the most crucial procedures that should not be touched. I began creating the UI wireframes for the various pages while also paying closer attention to the TOTP feature, taking his advice into account.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            As promised to Wai Hang, I was able to complete the front-end side of my features this week, including the operating pages and the digital keypad. To achieve the best results, I had spent days experimenting with various coding techniques. After finishing those features, I felt proud and successful, but I also realized that I couldn't stop there because I still had the TOTP function to work on, which was a crucial feature. I was able to conduct additional research on my TOTP feature, using the code that other developers on Stack Overflow had used to create the TOTP feature that generates a special QR code for each user, allowing them to access their customized one-time password by scanning the code. However, some adjustments had to be made to the codes, such as collecting each user's credit card information and developing a global encryption scheme for the one-time password. When I asked Wai Hang for help, he responded that he would look at it when he was done implementing the backend scripts for the operational pages I had created. I was aware of that, and as I awaited his reply, I carried on experimenting with the various internet codes to see if they would function similarly to the one I had been working on for the previous week. I kept an eye on the other members during the lesson to see whether they were keeping up with the timetable and needed any help. As was to be expected, the other group members were running behind schedule on their feature, and I reminded them to work harder since if they waited until the last minute, nobody would be able to assist them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the lesson after, our lecturer again approached each group to assess their development and determine whether they required assistance. We all offered him advice for our organization and questioned him about our direction. Regarding their machine learning feature, Cheng Xuan and Ahmad were unable to offer any fresh material, and our lecturer was very concerned with what they currently had given the remaining 2-weeks. She was successful in guiding Hwee Min through the process of putting her dashboard into use, and our lecturer complimented her efforts. Like me, our lecturer was a little concerned when Wai Hang revealed that he was a little behind schedule but was able to make up the time over the weekends. Additionally, our instructor asked Wai Hang and I to lend the other members of the group extra assistance because they lacked our level of coding expertise. For example, Wai Hang and Hwee Min set up an online meeting with one another where Wai Hang assisted her in connecting the database server to the PowerBi software through the link, allowing Hwee Min to continue with her part. Some of us had individual meetings with each other throughout the rest of the week when we faced difficulties implementing our feature.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            This week was ICT's "whitespace week," which meant that everyone was expected to complete their own tasks at their own pace and with their own goals because we had other assignments to complete and everyone was busy over the weekend due to Chinese New Year (OTOT). I texted the group chat to let them know how many days remained until each person's contribution was incorporated into the solution and to let them know to text the chat if they needed any help. I was able to develop the encrypting function for my TOTP feature to produce the user's time-based one-time password. However, despite my best efforts, I was unable to use the special link that contained the user's bank account information to display the QR code on the screen. Wai Hang was still setting up his backend code for the front-end operating pages that I created, so I continued with my trial-and-error process from earlier tries in the previous week. I brought him into a meeting and informed him of my progress and the issues I was having. Thankfully, he informed me that the backend code was almost finished, and he was able to look at the code for my features as I carefully explained each line to him. He assisted me in setting them up on my end because I was unfamiliar with his program and he was almost finished creating the users' information for his database and having everything set up. He considerably reduced my workload during the project, therefore I was really grateful for his assistance. We encountered a hurdle, though. After he was able to connect the database server from his computer to mine, we attempted to run the most recent code that had been pulled from the repository with the backend code in it, but the code did not manage to run even after my attempts because the error was caused by the fact that my laptop did not support the database version. The fact that it had been operating flawlessly when I used it for my Database module caught me off guard. Wai Hang ultimately chose to use my code on his end and agreed to assist me in testing it. As he was returning to Malaysia for the Chinese New Year vacation, he also indicated that it would take some time and that he would be unavailable from Friday until the following Monday. I brought up another problem I discovered at that discussion, the kill switch feature we had implemented for Assignment 1. I stated that the kill switch was not operating as we had previously believed. Given that it was a bug that resulted from the implementation of the backend code and that the software couldn't run on my laptop, he promised to take care of it. Wai Hang was delighted to assist despite the numerous tasks and other responsibilities he had to manage, despite the inconvenience of having to execute all the new revisions of the code on his personal laptop. I received bad news from the duo partners, Cheng Xuan and Ahmad, during the holiday weekend break that they intended to use another dataset from Kaggle to train the model that was also based on the reference link I had sent them. This was based solely on the links I had sent them for reference purposes. When I examined their dataset, I informed them that they would not be able to use it with our current application because the dataset's column names for the data were extremely general and ambiguous, making it impossible to determine what each column meant and leaving no way to incorporate data from the current user transaction and determine whether or not it was fraudulent. They responded by stating that it was the only dataset that they had discovered to be compatible with the internet linkages' models. This also meant that Hwee Min's dashboard and Wai Hang's database were unable to save this particular set of data and utilise it. I then beg them to keep looking for alternate approaches to the model trainings and, if necessary, to fall back on their backup plan. We were unable to provide much assistance because the other group members are also quite busy during the holidays. I also asked them if the current solutions they had suggested could be combined with the one we already had. They gave a "no" response, claiming they had no idea about the integration part. With only a week left before the final submission, it was a very last-minute conversation, and it was not going well for their feature, so when I heard that, I was enraged beyond belief. Since everyone was busy, there wasn't much we could do but wait until we got back to school to continue our conversation.

                        <span class="opacity-30"> 
                            We sat down to discuss our work for the final sprint before the Friday submission deadline as soon as we returned to class on Wednesday following the lengthy holiday weekend. Everyone's component should have been completed to 90–100% and integrated into the solution by this point. I started the conversation by letting everyone know that Wai Hang was still working on the TOTP feature even though I had finished writing all the front end code for the solution. Since one of the deliverables called for us to build a 3-minute presentation film with slides, I made a base template for the slides and shared it with the group so they could add their own features after it was finished. Wai Hang informed me that he was only halfway through working on my feature and that he needed my assistance in understanding some of the code that I had previously provided for him. Since every student in our class was either completing an assignment or giving a presentation for an assignment, I recommended that we call this afternoon and perhaps tomorrow if necessary to finish the features. I also inquired about the status of the other things he was working on, and I finally received some encouraging news when he said that everything had been finished. The speaker after Hwee Min described how she had created the dashboard's basic visuals and table layout and was just waiting for the machine learning component to be finished and incorporated. I then discussed the machine learning functionality that Ahmad and Cheng Xuan had developed. In their response, they explained that they had run out of options and that their fallback option was to establish a one-time password that would be sent to the user's email from their bank account. I was surprised to hear that because it was so similar to my time-based one-time password feature, so I questioned them as to why they had taken my idea. They admitted guilt, claiming that they had no other option and that it was the only online solution they could discover. This was different from my approach, in which I used a QR code to send the user a special OTP. When I learned it, I became angry because I had given them enough time to complete their feature and instructed them to create a timeline and a backup plan in case something went wrong. However, they didn't do this at first and didn't begin to worry until the deadline was approaching. At that point, our lecturer stopped by to see how we were doing. I informed him of our current problem and then solicited his opinion. With only a few days left, he was not happy with our slow progress and encouraged us to get ourselves up. He also said that we had to keep on with the last-minute adjustments since we had no other choice but to make them. We followed his advise, and the two partners informed them that given the little time left, they would be unable to integrate the solution into the main application and would instead need to develop it on a separate application. I gave the go-ahead while having reservations about my choice. Following the advise of our lecturer, we made the decision to modify the machine learning section of the dashboard and turn it into a table to show the current transaction. Since our lecturer mentioned that everyone had to present for the presentation with no exceptions, I also divided up the slides during that lesson and assigned everyone to a particular section. I was in charge of the introduction while the other team members divided up the remaining slides, which included the problem analysis, an overview of previous solutions, etc. Each of us additionally had to demonstrate to our instructor how our unique qualities should be presented. After giving each of them a slide to work on, I gave a briefing on how the film would proceed and where their solutions would be shown. Given that the solutions were created using various platforms and apps, I gave each of them the assignment of recording their solutions according to the time restriction I had given to them. I informed the group through text message all the crucial information they needed to be aware of, including the presentation order, the allotted time for the video, and the due dates. I was firm in my warnings, informing them that if any of them elected to submit late, I would not be endangering the grades of the other members.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Wai Hang and I met for five hours after that lesson to pair program our way through the flaws and problems that came up. After explaining the codes to him, we initially spent a lot of time attempting to figure out where we had gone wrong with the TOTP feature. After struggling with the issue for a while, we were able to find a solution with the aid of some videos and internet research, as we discovered several solutions to get the special link to display the QR code and validate the 6-digit code entered by the user with the program application. After we fixed everything, Wai Hang was able to finish the slides and the film, and I exhaled a sigh of relief. Since all of my features were on his computer, I kindly requested his assistance in adding them to his film, which I would then edit with the other members' videos. I worked on my section of the slides, which were the introduction of the problem and my unique contributions in the final assignment, in the time I had left till Thursday night (the deadline I gave them to bring me the video for editing). I also responded to any inquiries the team had posted in the group chat at the same time.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On the submission day, I compiled every video they had sent and went over it. I contacted them after seeing a few little mistakes in several of their videos and asked for a different video that didn't have those mistakes. The team members were able to smooth through those little glitches and quickly sent it back to me. I started out by editing the movie so that it could flow well between all of its parts and added a few details to describe the various elements it covered. I sent it to the group chat after making some last-minute adjustments and requested their approval. I then go on to see how they are doing with the slides. I was startled to learn that all of them had duplicated my design without even the slightest modification to make the presentations look more unique and presentable, even though the slides contained the most of their important information. I worked on the slides' layout for the remainder of the afternoon and evening, making a few more modifications. I continued by adding the translations and animation to the deck of slides and adding a note with a draft of my script. I quickly entered the scripts, slides, and video into Brightspace after receiving the last-minute approval from my team. Thankfully, there were no significant obstacles in the last phase, and everyone was proactive in making their own contributions.

                            We regrouped in MsTeams on Monday evening to go through another practice run of our presentation, as had been previously agreed upon. Because of this, we were able to ensure that everyone understood the role that they were supposed to play in the slides and when they were supposed to enter the room. As a result of the fact that the time given to us was overrun, we had to rush a few times and shorten some of our sections. It was a terrific opportunity, especially considering that repetition is the mother of memorization and retention.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On Wednesday, the day of the presentation, I had a lot of butterflies in my stomach and felt rather worried about giving the presentation. Thankfully, everything went according to plan, and our lecturer thought that our presentation went well overall as a whole. In addition to that, he provided us with some insightful criticism based on his point of view. There are a variety of reasons for this, some of which include the following: the reason that the time-based OTP automatically sends another code without any verification that the end user was not a scammer; how the entire solution would be improved if the machine learning feature was integrated; how the email OTP feature actually benefited the users after scanning the QR code; and many other reasons. He made an excellent argument, one that I agree with, and I should have given it more thought early on in the process of putting it into action. After saying our thanks to the presenter, we went our separate ways and finished the PFD module.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In general, I think that this program was an excellent opportunity for educational growth. By utilizing a UWP C# application to address issues related to scams, I was able to expand my knowledge of programming. The ability of everyone to persevere in spite of the disputes and obstacles faced while working on the projects was one of the reasons why my experience of working with people I did not know at the outset was such a valuable educational opportunity.
